Hey @nikkuAg,

I encountered an issue with the gender filter option on the "Opening and Closing Ranks" tab of your Rank Matrix website. When I apply the gender filter, the page returns empty results. This seems to be a problem with the `/rank` API endpoint.

Could you please investigate and resolve this as soon as possible?

I've attached screenshots for reference:

Thank you!
